# Some Like It Hot
Finding Great Tacos in the Austin area

## General Information
This Ruby on Rails app helps users find tacos in Austin that match preferences according to cost, spiciness, and vegetarian/non-vegetarian options. Users can create profiles and add or update restaurants.

## Installing and running the app
Prior to installing this app, you'll first need Ruby and Ruby on Rails installed on your machine. For more information, refer to Rails Guides chapter 3.1: [Installing Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#installing-rails).

When downloading the ZIP file, maintain the existing folder structure to assure files link correctly.

Change the directory to `hot_app`

Run `rake db:create` to create a database on your local machine. You can also run `rake db:seed` to load sample restaurants.

Start the web server using `rails server` (or `rails s`). Visit the default port in your favorite web browser (most likely `http://localhost:3000`) and you'll see the app homepage.

## Technologies Used
Some Like It Hot is built on Ruby on Rails, using [Sorcery](https://github.com/NoamB/sorcery) for authentication and a PostgreSQL database.
